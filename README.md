# What's Up for Fire TV (Vega OS)

A "what's flying over me" display for Fire TV (Vega OS), for anywhere, in twelve layouts.
Includes MIT-licensed code by Alex Miller; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Package id `com.bureauobscura.whatsup`.

* **Location.** First launch looks up an approximate location from the IP address (GeoJS:
  the Vega SDK has a geolocation interface, but only as native C++ IDL with no JS package)
  and shows "Watching the sky over <City, ST>" with *Change location*. Change location is an
  on-screen keyboard for the remote: type a ZIP/postcode or city, pick a result (Open-Meteo
  geocoding, which also gives the time zone). Saved on the device.
* **Precise location.** The IP guess is shown as "Is this right?" with the lookup's claimed
  accuracy and a warning that it is often off by 10+ miles. Change location also takes a full
  street address (press Search): US Census geocoder for US addresses, else Nominatim, and the
  match is shown back before it is used. *Adjust position* (Settings, or from the match) shows a
  close-up street map (OpenFreeMap z13) and the remote's arrows move the home dot ~50 m a press
  (faster when held); OK saves. Exact coordinates stay on the device: adsb.fi gets them rounded
  to 2 decimals (~1 km; the 15 NM query loses nothing), the time-zone lookup the same, the
  geocoders only the typed text, and map tiles only the z10/z12/z13/z14 tile area.
* **Settings** (press Select on the dashboard): layout, location, alert radius 1–10 mi, map
  radius 2–250 mi (also Up/Down on the dashboard; the alert ring never exceeds it),
  keep screen awake (on by default: a silent, invisible 10 s loop in Vega's native player
  holds off the screensaver while the app is shown; see `src/silentLoop.ts` before an Appstore build),
  distance mi/km (speed kt or km/h), altitude ft/m. Back closes.
* **Layouts.** Settings > Layout opens a bar over the live dashboard: left/right switch
  layouts on the spot, OK keeps one, Back goes back to the saved one. 1 Radar (green
  phosphor scope), 2 Glass, 3 Departures (split-flap board), 4 Blueprint, 5 Atlas (full city
  map), 6 Atlas Dark (Atlas at night), 7 Atlas Satellite (USGS / Sentinel-2 imagery), 8 Swiss
  (poster), 9 Synthwave, 10 Sectional (VFR chart), 11 Cockpit (navigation display), 12 Night Sky. Each picks its own fields, colours, fonts and map style, handles an
  empty sky and shows squawk 7500/7600/7700 in its own style. Data and map credits show for
  ~5 s (on open, layout change and a new location's map), then fade; Settings lists them in full.
  Only the chosen layout's code, stylesheet and font are loaded.
* **Maps.** Built on the device for any location from OpenMapTiles vector tiles
  (OpenFreeMap), decoded with @mapbox/vector-tile + pbf. Every layout has the base map
  (z10, the 10-mile area: water, rivers, motorways, runways, airport codes, town names;
  4–9 tiles, ~30 KB saved). Layouts that draw streets also get a detail map, built the first
  time one is chosen: z12 tiles over ~6.5 mi (every road class, rail, waterways, landuse,
  parks, aeroways, place names) plus z14 buildings within ~1.3 mi, delta-encoded (~1.3 MB
  saved in localStorage, decoded to Int16Arrays). Both are reused for 30 days. Maps are
  painted once onto a canvas; aircraft are an SVG/DOM layer on top.
* **Display.** Hero target (route, progress, altitude/vertical speed, speed, look-up
  direction and elevation, closest approach, type, registration), cargo tonight by operator
  (callsign prefixes worldwide; Amazon Air by owner), today's logbook, recently above,
  and a red takeover on squawk 7500/7600/7700. Airports come from the map data.

## Code

* `web/` the page. `app.mjs` (data, Settings and location screens, Adjust position, layout
  picker and loader), `kit.mjs` (what layouts share: units, plane shapes, map painter, label
  placement, credits), `layouts/<id>.mjs` + `layouts/<id>.css` (one per layout, see the
  contract at the top of `kit.mjs`), `model.mjs` (enrichment, cargo, logbook, demo),
  `mapgen.mjs` (vector tiles → base and detail maps), `place.mjs` (IP location, geocoding,
  settings), `live.mjs` (adsb.fi + ADSB.lol), `mvt.js` (bundled vector-tile
  decoder, rebuild with `npm run build:vendor`), `fonts/` (OFL fonts, Latin subsets).
* `scripts/build-web.mjs` joins the shared modules into `assets/whatsup.js` (ES modules don't
  load from `file:///pkg/assets/`) and turns each layout into `assets/layouts/<id>.js`, which
  the page loads with a script tag when that layout is chosen and drops when another is.
* `src/App.tsx` the Vega app: a full-screen WebView plus a fetch bridge (adsb.fi sends no CORS
  header) limited to the allow-listed GET URLs, and the remote's Back button (closes a screen,
  else leaves the app).
